       Unsupported Version of WPSD Installed
    </h3>
    <p>You are running a version of WPSD that is now unsupported.
      This means that you had installed WPSD over an existing Pi-Star installation,
      which is now <a style="text-decoration:underline;color:blue !important;"
      href="https://w0chp.net/musings/wpsd-disk-images-only/"
      target="_new">end-of-life and is not updated any longer</a>.
    </p>
    <p>To continue to receive updates and to take advantage of new WPSD features, you MUST
      install WPSD <a style="text-decoration:underline;color:blue !important;" href="https://w0chp.net/wpsd/#download-wpsd"
      target="_new">using a proper disk image for your hardware</a>. <em>Failing to do this will also
      result in a system with no updates and no support.</em>.<br />By January 1, 2024, your legacy installation will <strong>not</strong> receive any updates, and may result in an installation that does not work properly.</p>
    <p>Before upgrading using a disk image, <a style="text-decoration:underline;color:blue !important;" href="/admin/config_backup.php">make a backup of your configuration</a> which you can
      restore once the disk image installation is completed.
    </p>

## About WPSD

WPSD is a next-generation, digital voice software suite for amateur radio use.
It is used for personal hotspots and repeaters alike. It supports M17, DMR,
D-Star, Yaesu System Fusion (YSF/C4FM), P25, NXDN digital voice modes & POCSAG
data/paging.

WPSD began as a derivative/“fork” of the popular Pi-Star software, and has
evolved into its very own software and distribution over the years. It is
available as a disk image, and multiple platforms are supported.
